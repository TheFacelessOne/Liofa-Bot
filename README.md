##### About Liofa

Liofa (or Líofa) is Irish for "fluent".

I came up with the idea because I was an administrator for a discord server where it was against the rules to speak languages other than English. I found it frustrating to have to translate "Please speak English" into so many languages that I decided to make a command using another Discord bot to do this instead. Then I had the idea to just automate the process with my own bot.

I hope you all enjoy my little bot. If you have any questions or suggestions, please do let me know. I started this project when I was still relatively new to coding and with the help of some fantastic people, I can say I'm proud of what it has become.
